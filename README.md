This is a C-based implementation of a Pac-Man style game designed to run in the console. The game draws a maze, places Pac-Man and the ghosts, and tracks real-time movement, collisions, and score updates.

Specific Explanations

The core logic handles keyboard input (to move Pac-Man) and updates the positions of ghosts accordingly.

Functions or modules dedicated to the maze manage the board layout, collisions with walls, and item placements (like dots or power-ups).

A scoring mechanism counts collected items and handles game-over conditions if Pac-Man collides with a ghost.
